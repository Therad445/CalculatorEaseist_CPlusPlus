## Overview
The project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator supports operations with both integers and floating-point numbers.
## Features
- Addition (`+`)- Subtraction (`-`)- Multiplication (`*`)- Division (`/`) with error handling for division by zero- Support for both integer and floating-point arithmetic
## Project Structure
- **main.cpp**: The main file of the program, containing the entry point, calculator logic, and user input handling.- **Calculator.h**: Header file containing the `Calculator` class definition.- **Calculator.cpp**: Implementation file for the `Calculator` class methods.
## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash   git clone https://github.com/Therad445/CalculatorEaseist_CPlusPlus.git   ```
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash   g++ main.cpp Calculator.cpp -o EasyCalcPlusPlus   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash   ./EasyCalcPlusPlus   ```
## Example Usage
After running the program, you'll be prompted to enter an arithmetic expression. For example:
```Enter an expression: 5 + 3Result: 8```
The program will continuously prompt for input until you choose to exit.
